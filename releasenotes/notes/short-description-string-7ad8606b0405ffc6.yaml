    Introduced new functionality that allows a previously calculated driver
    result to be passed as an optional argument when using an eigensolver.
    This allows the solver to avoid doing redundant calculations.
    
    Example Usage::
        driver_result = driver.run()
        problem = ElectronicStructureProblem(driver, tranformers=[])
        qubit_converter = QubitConverter(ParityMapper(), two_qubit_reduction=True)
        gs_solver = GroundStateEigenSolver(qubit_converter, NumPyMinimumEigensolver())
        gs_result = gs_solver.solve(problem, driver_result=driver_result)
